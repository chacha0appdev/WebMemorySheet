# Web Memory Sheet - User Guide

This page provides a simple guide on how to use **Web Memory Sheet**.

## What is this app?

Are you familiar with the classic "red sheet" memorization method used by students?  
It’s the one where you use a red transparent sheet to hide highlighted text and test your memory.  
**Web Memory Sheet is an app that brings that method to your smartphone!**

You can turn textbooks, notebooks, and educational websites into digital memory sheets—quick and easy.

You can use educational websites, photos of your textbooks or notebooks (please get permission from your teacher if needed), and turn them into memory sheets with just a few taps.

Let’s get started with how to use the app.
